#### Functionality:
1. **Initialization**: Sets up parameters, initializes arrays for response calculation, and calculates stiffness.
2. **Spectral Calculation Loop**: Iterates over a range of periods, updating response values using the modified Newmark method.
3. **Conversion and Plotting**: Converts arrays to lists and uses Matplotlib to plot the seismic record and acceleration response spectra. Includes interactive features for better visualization.

#### Visualization:
- **Figure 1 - Seismic Record**: Plots the seismic record over time with highlights on the peak ground acceleration (PGA).
- **Figure 2 - Acceleration Response Spectra**: Displays the acceleration response spectra over a range of periods with interactive draggable line and marker.

#### Usage:
This function is useful for engineers, researchers, and students involved in the study of seismic effects on structures. It's particularly beneficial for spectral analysis and understanding the dynamic response over a range of structural periods. Recommended parameters for a typical use case might include:
- `To` = Initial period, e.g., 0.1.
- `Tf` = Final period, e.g., 3.0.
- `dT` = Period step size, e.g., 0.05.
- `zi` = Damping ratio, e.g., 0.05 for 5% damping.
- `xo` = Initial displacement, typically 0.
- `xvo` = Initial velocity, typically 0.
- `TG` = Time vector from seismic record.
- `SG` = Acceleration data from seismic record.
- `record` = Identifier for the seismic record, e.g., "ChiChi_Long Earthquake".

**Note**: The function includes interactive features for enhanced visualization. Users can explore the response spectra by moving the cursor along the curve. The seismic record and spectral plots provide valuable insights into the structural response under seismic loading. Attached in this same repository is a file (.AT2) that contains a seismic record organized in 2 columns. The first column has the time of the record and the second column has the corresponding acceleration in a fraction of gravity.
